 Time Series Prediction with LSTM Model for Stock Price Prediction

Introduction
This documentation outlines the process of building a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting stock prices using time series data. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.

Steps Involved
1.Data Collection: Stock price data is obtained from a reliable source such as investing.com. The data typically includes features like Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume traded.

2.Data Preprocessing:
   - The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Irrelevant columns are dropped, and missing values are handled if any.
   - The 'Open' price column, which will be the target variable for prediction, is selected for analysis.

3. Data Exploration:
   - Visualizations like line plots are created to understand the trends and patterns in the stock prices over time.
   - Descriptive statistics are computed to gain insights into the distribution of stock prices.

4. Data Normalization:
   - The 'Open' price data is normalized using Min-Max scaling to bring the values within the range [0, 1]. This step helps in improving the convergence of the model during training.

5.Sequence Generation:
   - Sequences of input features and target variables are generated from the normalized data. Each sequence contains a fixed number of time steps, which represent historical data used for prediction.
   
6. Model Building:
   - A Sequential model is constructed using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.
   - The model architecture typically consists of one or more LSTM layers followed by dense layers.
   - The model is compiled with appropriate loss function (e.g., mean squared error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).

7. Model Training:
   - The model is trained on the training dataset using the `fit()` method.
   - Training is performed for a specified number of epochs, with early stopping as an option to prevent overfitting.

8. Model Evaluation:
   - The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance.
   - Evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are computed to measure the model's accuracy in predicting stock prices.

9. Loss Visualization:
   - The loss values recorded during training are visualized using line plots to monitor the training progress and identify potential overfitting or underfitting.

10.Prediction and Analysis:
    - Finally, the trained model can be used to make predictions on new/unseen data for stock price forecasting.
    - Further analysis and fine-tuning of the model may be performed based on the prediction results and domain expertise.

Conclusion
Building an LSTM model for stock price prediction involves several steps including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. By following these steps and iterating on the model architecture and hyperparameters, accurate predictions of stock prices can be achieved, aiding in investment decision-making and financial analysis.
